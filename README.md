# Jobber clone

This is my a excercise to copy a local company's main page to practice front end and css. The company I coppied is call jobber (https://getjobber.com/#check-it-out) and was only doing this for learing purposes.

## Some small things I would like to work on in the future would be
- I got most of the hover effects to match but the underline needs some work on the navigation bar.
- The Try Jobbing button needs more time
- The down arrow was not the same but used a similar font awesome that was similar 
- Would love to figure out the tearing effect on the bottom section
